# PanCardTampering
This project helps in detecting the tampered id cards using computer vision, i.e in this project it is pan card. 
With the help of this project you can even develop a model that detects the tampered id cards either it maybe adhar card, credit card, any govt id cards.

This project was classified into 10 steps: 

Step1: Get images from user.

Step2: Check for size and format of the image.

Step3: Change size and shape of the image according to the original image.

Step4: Convert the image into grayscale.

Step5: Find the similarity index of the images.

Step6: Finding threshold of the image.

Step7: Finding contours and grab those contours using IMUTILS.

Step8: Draw a bounding rectangles using contours.

Step9: Plot differences and Threshold of the original and tampered images.

Step10: Compare all the images and check the similarity score to decide tampering.
